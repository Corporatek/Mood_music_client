MOOD MUSIC APP


MUSIC APP CONCEPT
===
EQ Music is an app that filters music based on its beats per minute. I wanted to make an app that correlates with human emotions because I want people to be able to create playlists that can help them control their emotions during good and bad times. This version of the platform will only have Drake as an artist and is meant to show off the functionality.
